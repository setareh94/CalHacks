<h1>Store With Me</h1>
<p>Storage Place under your fingertips! Being a out of state student in college is a mess! Everytime you want to go for a break you need to take all of your belongies back home before the fall semster starts again or you need to pay bunch of money to the storage space but what if you can make money out of your empty closet and store someone else stuff? Providing available storage space for others to rent out, we came up with this idea because, as college students, we're sometimes not able to bring all our possessions on an airplane back home for a long break. This app helps to give resources to not only college students, but anyone who looking for affordable ways to store items that aren't feasible for conventional storage solutions. It also allows people with space to spare to make a little bit of money with virtually no work involved. We operate as the middle man, connecting the renters and the rentees. Special features of this application include the bootstrap css design, geolocation features, Dropbox integration, and responsive iOS and website UI designs.</p>
<p>Introducing Store with Me! Just like how you can pick up girls in your 2 miles you can use your phone to find the storage space for your stuff within your 2miles (JUST LIKE TINDER!!)</p>
<p> Currently avilable for iOS and Desktop, this is fall 2014 CalHacks hack using Parse as backend</p>
